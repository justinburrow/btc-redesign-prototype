        <p>In the newsletter we stated that new checkout would be available later this week. While testing the new checkout experience we have found a few issues that will need to be resolved, thus delaying the launch. We hope to launch the new and improved checkout experience as soon as possible and will let you know as soon as we have a new date. Thank you for your patience.</p>
